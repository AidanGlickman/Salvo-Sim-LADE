# Comparison of Combat Strategies Through Varied Stochastic Salvo Combat Models

## The Simulation

The simulation lives in `Simulation.py` and has its dependencies managed by [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/). It has a few scenarios hardcoded, and can be easily modified to add more.

## The Paper

The source for the paper is `LADE Project.md`, and was compiled using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) to `output/LADE Project.pdf` by way of `LaTeX`.
